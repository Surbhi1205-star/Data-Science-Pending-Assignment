    "1. Difference Between User-Based and Item-Based Collaborative Filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "Collaborative filtering is a technique used in recommendation systems that relies on user interactions (ratings, views, purchases, etc.) to make predictions.\n",
    "User-Based Collaborative Filtering (UBCF)\n",
    "\n",
    "    Concept: Finds users with similar tastes/preferences and recommends items that similar users liked.\n",
    "    How It Works:\n",
    "        Identify users who have similar behavior (e.g., watch history, ratings).\n",
    "        Recommend items that those similar users have interacted with but the target user hasn't seen yet.\n",
    "    Example:\n",
    "        User A and User B have watched and rated 5 similar anime highly.\n",
    "        User A watches Attack on Titan, but User B hasn’t.\n",
    "        Since their preferences match, Attack on Titan is recommended to User B.\n",
    "    Pros: Works well when users have a consistent preference pattern.\n",
    "    Cons: Struggles when users have few ratings (cold start problem).\n",
    "\n",
    "Item-Based Collaborative Filtering (IBCF)\n",
    "\n",
    "    Concept: Finds similar items and recommends them based on past user interactions.\n",
    "    How It Works:\n",
    "        Identify items that are often liked together.\n",
    "        If a user likes one item, recommend similar items.\n",
    "    Example:\n",
    "        If many users who watched Naruto also watched Bleach, then Bleach is recommended to Naruto fans.\n",
    "    Pros: Works better for large-scale datasets because item similarity is more stable than user similarity.\n",
    "    Cons: Struggles with new items (cold start problem) since it relies on past user interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is Collaborative Filtering and How Does It Work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Collaborative Filtering (CF) is a recommendation technique that predicts a user's interest based on their past interactions and similarities with other users or items. It works without requiring explicit attributes (e.g., genre, type) but rather learns from user behavior.\n",
    "Steps in Collaborative Filtering:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Collect User-Item Interaction Data (ratings, clicks, views, purchases).\n",
    "    Calculate Similarities (between users or items) using metrics like cosine similarity, Pearson correlation, or Euclidean distance.\n",
    "    Generate Recommendations:\n",
    "        User-Based CF: Recommend items liked by similar users.\n",
    "        Item-Based CF: Recommend items similar to those the user has interacted with.\n",
    "    Present Recommendations (ranked by similarity scores).\n",
    "\n",
    "Types of Collaborative Filtering:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Memory-Based (traditional method using similarity metrics).\n",
    "    Model-Based (uses ML algorithms like Matrix Factorization, SVD, or Deep Learning).\n",
    "\n",
    "Pros & Cons:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Pros:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Works well for personalized recommendations.\n",
    "    Requires no domain knowledge about items.\n",
    "    ❌ Cons:\n",
    "    Struggles with cold start problem (new users/items).\n",
    "    Can be computationally expensive for large datasets."
